            <h3 class="text-center ">ABOUT THE FOUNDER</h3>
            <p>
                Somtochukwu Collins Nwizu, the visionary behind DoinsX Talent Management Company, is a man 
                whose story embodies resilience, determination, and a deep passion for empowering others. 
                Armed with a BSc in Economics, he always believed in the power of discipline and hard work. 
                But beyond academics, his true passion lay in football. Growing up, Somtochukwu dreamt of 
                becoming a professional footballer, and he was on the verge of launching a promising career 
                in the sport he loved.
                <br>
                However, just as his journey was beginning, unforeseen circumstances forced him to retire 
                prematurely, cutting short his dreams and leaving him devastated. The abrupt end of his 
                football career was a painful turning point that tested his spirit. But rather than let the 
                disappointment define him, Somtochukwu found a new path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determined to remain connected to the sport and help others achieve what he could not, he 
                pursued and achieved certification as a FIFA-licensed football agent. This role allowed him 
                to stay rooted in the football world while working to support young talents on their own 
                journeys. However, his vision didn’t stop at football. Recognizing the vast pool of untapped 
                talent in Nigeria and the challenges faced by youths across various fields, Somtochukwu 
                decided to expand his mission. This decision gave birth to DoinsX Talent Management Company, 
                a platform dedicated to discovering, nurturing, and empowering Nigerian youths to unlock their 
                full potential and succeed in their chosen careers. With a profound understanding of the 
                obstacles that come with chasing dreams, Somtochukwu has made it his life’s mission to 
                provide guidance, mentorship, and access to opportunities for young talents. His journey 
                from heartbreak to purpose serves as a powerful reminder that setbacks can lead to new 
                beginnings, and that with resilience and determination, impossibility is nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under Somtochukwu’s leadership, DoinsX Talent Management Company has grown into a beacon 
                of hope for aspiring talents in Nigeria, ensuring that no dream is left unfulfilled and that 
                the next generation has the tools to succeed on a global stage.
